# Comparison-of-Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption-Algorithms-based-on-the-tenSEAL

## Scenario Setup

1. Select M images of size 64x64 (or larger) and store them encrypted in a database or file.
2. For a query image, perform matching with the encrypted images stored in the database or file while maintaining the encrypted state.
3. For more information, see "report.pdf".
